## The Project

As a newly assembled team of six, we were assigned an open brief to design a full-stack application as a solution to a problem we identified. Working with an agile methodology, we had four weeks to ideate, plan, design, and implement our chosen solution.

We managed the project using Trello to track daily standups and retros, as well as for ticketing out the project. The duty of daily 'project manager' was rotated to give everyone on the team this opportunity and experience.

After deciding our initial MVP, we split to project into sprints to work on frontend, backend, testing and refactoring, and the presentation. By managing our time proactively and communicating well as a team, we stuck to our timeframes and managed to complete our plan for the MVP - as well as implenting one of our stretch goals of authentication.

## The Problem and Our Solution

Holiday Helper is an app to help travelers organise different elements of their holiday, designed to host various tools in one place and lessen the need to visit multiple locations to find different types of information.

Though holidays are meant to be a break from the everyday stresses of life, there are often so many moving parts that it can be easy for that time-out to become another source of stress in itself; Holiday Helper aims to relieve some of that with centralised information and tools to help travellers.

## Future Implementation

There are a number of other features we would like to have implemented with more time, to make the app an even better solution.

Following early user feedback, the first of these would be an Itinerary Calender/Organiser, where the user could store details of their trip and schedule reminders/notifications. In our user feedback, this returned the highest amount of interest, alongside an Itinerary Saver that would allow the user to capture flight/ticket/insurance information for easy access and recall.

As we would be looking to build out new features that would rely on further integration with notification capabilities and possibly capturing images, we would also look at moving the next build of the app to React Native to better capitalise on mobile functionality.
